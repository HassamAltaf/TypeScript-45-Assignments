// Q10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Name: Hassam Ul Haq
// Date: 30-May-2024
// Storing my  favourite number in a variable.

let favouriteNumber: number = 8
console.log(`My favorite number is ${favouriteNumber}.`)          // Printing  my favourite number in a message format.

// Name: Hassam Ul Haq
// Date: 30-May-2024
// Storing the personName in a variable.

let personName: string = "Hassam Ul Haq"
console.log("Hi",(personName),"would you like to learn some python today?")     // Printing a message to the person.
