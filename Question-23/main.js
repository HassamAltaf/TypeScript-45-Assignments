// Q23: Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
var six = 6;
var four = 4;
console.log("Test no 1: six is equal to 6");
console.log(six == 6);
console.log("Test no 2: four is equal to 4");
console.log(four == 4);
console.log("Test no 3: six is not equal to 4");
console.log(six != 4);
console.log("Test no 4: four is greater than 3");
console.log(four > 3);
console.log("Test no 5: four is less than 5");
console.log(four < 5);
console.log("Test 6: six is less than 4");
console.log(six < 4);
console.log("Test 7: 6 is equal to 2");
console.log(six == 2);
console.log("Test 8: 6 is not equal to 6");
console.log(6 != 6);
console.log("Test 9: 6 is greater than 10");
console.log(6 > 10);
console.log("Test 10: 4 is not equal to 4");
console.log(4 != 4);
